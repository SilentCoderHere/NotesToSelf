# 📝 NotesToSelf

**NotesToSelf** is a simple and modern note-taking app built with **Flutter** using **Material Design 3 (MD3)**.
It helps you quickly jot down thoughts, ideas, or reminders in a clean and private way.

I built this app because I couldn’t find one that does this job simply and beautifully.
